 ## Usage
Calendar that you can plan your day for each individual day and save to local storage. This way if you have a daily routine then it can be completed and displayed using this. 

 ## Roadmap
Add a button that causes program to run, with a prompt asking user when their day starts and when it ends and that will be put into the for loop instead of preset limits.
